## Espresso PID Controller
PID controller being used on a pre-2015 Gaggia Classic boiler

The slow responding and somewhat innacturate bimetal coffee thermostat is replaced with a K type thermocouple
connected to an Arduino controller that controls a Solid State Relay (SSR) to control power to the small boiler inside
the espresso machine.
